# interactive-graph-app
This is an interactive graph that represents the female narrators of hadith and their teacher/student networks. The app is constructed using [Cytoscape]([url](https://cytoscape.org/))'s [demo](https://github.com/cytoscape/wineandcheesemap). The [data sets](https://github.com/muhaddithat/interactive-graph-app/tree/gh-pages/data) are constructed using [Graphspace](https://graphspace.org/). More information on dataset construction can be found at [this repo](https://github.com/muhaddithat/isnad-datasets).

This project was constructed as a capstone project for my Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities at Northeastern University. Learn more about at the project website, [www.muhaddithat.net](https://www.muhaddithat.net).
